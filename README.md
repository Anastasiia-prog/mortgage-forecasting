# mortgage-forecasting
I predict mortgage lending based on external factors, such as exchange rates, key rates, etc. I perform correlation analysis, use the Granger test for causality, and predict using several models: ARIMAX and ARIMA, multivariate LSTM and transfer learning with LSTM.
I got the best result with ARIMAX.
